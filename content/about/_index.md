Who am I
========

Heya ^^/ I'm Coralynn, I think a lot about Open Source software and friends, programming, workflow, and on occasion I dabble in some art.

It is because of Open Source I was able to get into computing, learn programming, and become the tech nerd I am today. With that in mind I am pragmatic, if it's not the right choice, it just isn't.

I am not particularly trendy with programming, I started on C, and have ventured into many different realms. I have a bucket list of sorts, and would like to try some lesser appreciated languages. That said, I do have a Go to language.

My workflow is very personal to me, and maybe I'll walk through how it works in its entirety one day, but it's ever evolving, and yes I do put probably more time into than I make up for by having it, but that doesn't matter. I enjoy what I do more as a result, and it keeps my interests fun.

As for art, I never thought of myself as an artist, but I got into a VRChat in 2020, and promised myself to make my own avatar, no asterisks. Around 4 years later, I finally tried after many failed attempts, and it happened. From the mesh, to the bones, to the shader, my work, no asterisk.

After that diversion I am back to programming, much of my code is not public, and many projects abandoned, but I take the same approach. I will try, fail, get back up and try again. Eventually I will have something I am proud of and am ready to release into the world and maintain.

If you want, you can reach out to me: Coralynn \[at\] cyn.sh, or on Discord @CoralynnMay, but do so with intention, I do not respond to "Hi," or random friend requests, talk to me first. If your intention is to befriend, I welcome it, but be a bit more creative than "Hi."
